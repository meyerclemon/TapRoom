# React Tap Room

#### By **Maya Frame** 7/6/2019

## Description
* As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price.
* As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. Perhaps based on their price (greater or less than $5 per pint, perhaps) or the particular style of beer or kombucha.
